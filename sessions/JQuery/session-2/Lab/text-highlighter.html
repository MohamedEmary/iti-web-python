      Since 2005, nineteen Christmas or New Year's special episodes have aired
      on the British science-fiction television series Doctor Who. During its
      original run, from 1963 to 1989, episodes were occasionally broadcast over
      holiday periods, but rarely made mention of the holidays. When Doctor Who
      was revived in 2005, special Christmas episodes were produced yearly until
      2017. From 2019 to 2022, the series transitioned to New Year's Day
      specials instead, returning to Christmas specials in 2023. The holiday
      episodes have proved to be a success with viewers, bringing in larger
      viewing figures than regular episodes. Doctor Who revolves around an alien
      known as the Doctor, who travels with a companion in a time and space
      machine called the TARDIS (pictured). A twentieth special, "Joy to the
      World", is set to be released on 25 December 2024. (Full list...)
