    "# Queue Data Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Queue class 1\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to implement a Python class that represents the queue data structure. The class should have these operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - `insert(value)`: Inserts a new value at the rear of the queue.\n",
    "   - `pop()`: Returns and removes a value from the front of the queue. We should return `None` and print a warning message if we try to pop a value from an empty queue.\n",
    "   - `is_empty()`: Returns `True` or `False` to represent whether the queue is empty or not.\n"
